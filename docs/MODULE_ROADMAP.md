## Maintenance Rule

Update this roadmap when any route is added, removed, renamed, or re-gated in the App router file.

## Route Topology Addendum (2026-05-03)

Route gating and default redirect behavior was centralized into a shared role-path helper used by App routing and login entry flow.

1. New helper: navigation rolePath helper (`src navigation rolePath.ts`)
   - getDefaultRouteForRole(role)
   - getRoleConstrainedRedirect(role, path, hasPortalChoice)
2. App router integration: App router (`src App.tsx`)
   - ProtectedRoute now delegates role-constrained redirects to rolePath helper.
   - RoleRoute and AreaRoute unauthorized redirects now route to role-aware defaults, not a blanket root redirect.
3. Login integration: Login page (`src pages Login.tsx`)
   - Post-auth redirect now uses role-aware defaults from rolePath helper.

Operational impact:

1. admin_officer portal-selection enforcement remains session-choice aware.
2. nzscv_monitor remains constrained to monitoring and account areas.
3. client persona roles remain constrained to client portal and account areas.
4. grand_master default landing remains /platform.
